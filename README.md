# numerical-analysis

code relative to bachelor course in University of Milano-Bicocca about numerical analysis

The purpose of the courseis modelling a bar suspended from the ceiling.

At first we use a discrete model, composed by a succession of masses and springs. The code relative to this part is contained in `./discrete`.

Secondly we use a continuous model. We start with using matlab symbolic computations to find the parameters of the parabolas that solve a simple case. Then we use the finite elements method to address the general problem.
